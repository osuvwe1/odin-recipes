    <h3>How To Cut Potato Wedges</h3>
    <p>To cut a potato into wedges, slice the potato in half lengthwise. Place the cut side of the potato onto the cutting board and cut it in half again to create quarters. Repeat with the other half. Now, position each potato quarter with the cut side up and cut down the center of each quarter to create a wedge. Repeat with the other quarters until the entire potato is cut into wedges.
